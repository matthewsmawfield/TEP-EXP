<h2>10. Conclusions</h2>

<p>
    This paper has presented a systematic methodological analysis of the canonical 
    precision tests of general relativity. The analysis reveals that these tests—while 
    representing extraordinary achievements in experimental physics—share structural 
    features that, as currently configured, do not directly probe the specific loop and correlation 
    observables that distinguish single-metric theories (GR) from two-metric alternatives such as the Temporal Equivalence Principle.
</p>

<h3>10.1 Principal Findings</h3>

<p>
    The analysis in Sections 3–8 demonstrates that the five structural limitations identified 
    in §1.2—two-way measurement dominance, local/global conflation, model-dependent calibration, 
    the conformal loophole, and theory-laden data reduction—are not isolated issues but 
    interconnected features of the experimental tradition.
</p>

<p>
    The underdetermination is structural, not accidental. Two-way measurements evolved because 
    they are simpler and provide gauge-invariant results. The PPN formalism, which guides most 
    precision tests, constrains the post-Newtonian limit in the sectors it parameterizes (solar-system dynamics and light propagation). 
    This makes it exceptionally powerful for ruling out many alternatives to GR, while leaving open the possibility of additional 
    clock-sector structure that is not reducible to a small set of PPN light-propagation parameters.
</p>

<h3>10.2 What the Tests Do Establish</h3>

<p>
    The critique presented here should not be misread as claiming that precision tests 
    are worthless. They establish important facts:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>GR provides a self-consistent framework for describing gravity</li>
    <li>Local Lorentz invariance holds to 10<sup>−18</sup> precision</li>
    <li>PPN parameters match GR predictions (γ = β = 1)</li>
    <li>GW–EM propagation speeds are bounded to differ by at most a few × 10<sup>−15</sup> under standard emission-time assumptions (constraining disformal coupling)</li>
    <li>No evidence for preferred-frame effects in two-way measurements</li>
</ul>

<p>
    These are genuine constraints on the space of viable theories. Many alternatives 
    to GR are ruled out by these tests. But TEP is not among them in the regime considered here: it can be formulated to satisfy the existing constraints while introducing additional clock-sector structure that is not directly targeted by the canonical measurement geometries.
</p>

<h3>10.3 The Path Forward</h3>

<h4>10.3.1 Discriminating Experiments</h4>

<p>
    The underdetermination is resolvable. Experiments that could distinguish GR from TEP include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Triangle Holonomy Test:</em> One-way timing around a large-area closed loop (e.g., ground-satellite-ground), measuring 
        a GR-subtracted residual holonomy $H_{\text{resid}}$. GR predicts $H_{\text{resid}} = 0$; a nonzero residual indicates non-exact time geometry.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Matter-Wave Interferometry:</em> Atom interferometers in gradiometric configurations sensitive to 
        gradients of the scalar field $\nabla\nabla \phi$ via the conformal factor, distinguishable from GR gravity by combining with mechanical gravimeters.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Interplanetary Closed-Loop Timing:</em> AU-scale, direction-reversed loop measurements constructed from one-way time-tagged links, targeting a GR-subtracted residual holonomy analogous to the terrestrial triangle observable.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>GNSS Correlation Replication:</em> Independent, blinded analysis of raw GNSS data 
        to verify or refute the distance-structured correlations suggested by exploratory analyses 
        within the TEP research program.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Optical Clock Networks:</em> Continental-scale networks using one-way 
        comparisons to probe synchronization structure at 10<sup>−18</sup> precision.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>10.3.2 The Scientific Imperative</h4>

<p>
    The dark matter problem, the Hubble tension, and the S₈ discrepancy all suggest 
    that current understanding of gravity may be incomplete. Testing alternatives to GR 
    is not merely an academic exercise—it addresses fundamental questions about the 
    nature of the universe.
</p>

<p>
    Optical clocks, one-way optical links, and GNSS infrastructure already exist. What is 
    needed is a shift in experimental philosophy: from improving precision within 
    the GR framework to designing tests that could falsify it.
</p>

<h4>10.3.3 Experimental Priorities</h4>

    The proposed discriminating experiments can be ranked by technical feasibility,

<div class="key-insight">
    <h4>Recommended Near-Term Strategy</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Immediate (0-2 years):</strong> Independent replication of GNSS correlation analysis 
        using raw RINEX data. This is the most cost-effective discriminating test and could provide strong evidence 
        for or against the existence of robust distance-structured correlations on continental-to-global baselines (order 10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> km).</li>
        
        <li><strong>Short-term (2-5 years):</strong> Modify existing optical clock network protocols to 
        enable one-way comparisons. This leverages substantial existing infrastructure (European fiber 
        network, NIST-JILA links) with minimal additional cost.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Medium-term (5-10 years):</strong> Develop ground-based triangle holonomy test using 
        intercontinental optical links. This requires new infrastructure but is technically feasible with 
        current technology.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Long-term (10+ years):</strong> Space-based holonomy tests and interplanetary missions 
        as part of broader fundamental physics programs (e.g., ACES follow-on, dedicated deep space clocks).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>Critical first step:</strong> The GNSS replication is both the highest priority and the 
        most feasible. If independent, blinded analysis confirms robust distance-structured correlations on continental-to-global baselines (order 10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> km), it would provide strong motivation 
        for the more expensive optical clock and holonomy experiments. If replication fails, any GNSS-informed interpretation would require substantial revision.

<h3>10.4 Concluding Remarks</h3>

<div class="conclusion-box">
    <h4>The Central Argument</h4>
    <p>
        The experimental foundations of general relativity are more specialized than 
        commonly appreciated—not because the experiments are flawed, but because they 
        were designed to test specific predictions within an assumed framework. Two-way 
        measurements, local comparisons, and single-path configurations excel at what 
        they were designed for; they do not directly probe synchronization structure. 
        The precision is extraordinary; the scope is necessarily limited.
    </p>
    <p>
        TEP remains viable within all existing constraints. This is not because TEP 
        is unfalsifiable—explicit falsification criteria exist—but because the 
        experiments that would test them have not been performed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The path forward is clear: design and execute experiments that break the 
        two-way symmetry. Measure holonomy. Test spatial correlations. Probe 
        synchronization structure directly. Only then will the experimental 
        foundations of relativistic physics be secure.

<p>
    Every entry in the "TEP Status" column reads "Compatible." This reflects the 
    structural nature of the underdetermination. The experimental canon, for all its 
    remarkable precision, was designed to test predictions that GR and TEP share. 
    The experiments succeed brilliantly at their intended purpose; they simply were 
    not designed to probe the specific observables where GR and TEP differ.
</p>

<p>
    This is not a criticism of the experimentalists who performed these measurements—their 
    work represents some of the greatest achievements in precision physics. It is an 
    observation about the logical structure of theory testing: to distinguish between 
    theories, one must measure observables where they make different predictions.
