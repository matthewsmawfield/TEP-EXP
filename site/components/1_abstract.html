        Most high-precision tests of general relativity constrain reciprocity-even, largely local observables 
        within single-metric frameworks. This leaves open a specific underdetermination 
        between General Relativity (GR) and a class of two-metric disformal scalar-tensor modifications, exemplified 
        here by the Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP).

        This paper formalizes a measurement taxonomy distinguishing gauge-invariant from convention-dependent 
        observables and identifies five recurring scope limitations in the experimental canon: 
        (1) two-way measurement dominance; (2) local/global conflation; (3) model-dependent calibration; 
        (4) the conformal loophole in multi-messenger constraints; and (5) theory-laden data reduction. 
        These characteristics do not diminish the experimental achievements but indicate that, in many cases, 
        the tests primarily constrain parameter space within assumed frameworks rather than systematically 
        discriminating between alternatives.

        Discriminating observables—specifically loop asymmetries and spatial correlations—are proposed, together with 
        experimental configurations capable of resolving the underdetermination. These include 
        large-area triangle holonomy tests (targeting residual synchronization holonomy $H_{\text{resid}}$), 
        interplanetary closed-loop timing, and matter-wave interferometry.
