<h2>1. Introduction: The Experimental Canon</h2>

<p>
    General relativity stands as one of the most precisely tested theories in physics. From the 
    gravitational redshift measurements of Pound and Rebka (1960) to the multi-messenger 
    observations of GW170817 (2017), a century of experiments has confirmed GR's predictions 
    with extraordinary precision. Modern optical lattice clocks achieve fractional frequency 
    comparisons at the 10<sup>−18</sup> level and below, detecting gravitational time dilation across 
    millimeter height differences. The Cassini spacecraft measured the Shapiro delay to 
    constrain the PPN parameter γ to within 2 × 10<sup>−5</sup> of unity. The Global Positioning 
    System, which incorporates relativistic corrections as a matter of routine engineering, 
    is often cited as the most practical demonstration that "GR works."
</p>

<p>
    The standard narrative concludes that these tests leave no room for alternatives to GR. 
    Any modification of gravity, the argument goes, would have been detected by now. The 
    experimental foundations are secure.
</p>

<p>
    This paper challenges that conclusion—not by disputing the experimental results, but by 
    examining what those results actually constrain. A systematic methodological analysis 
    reveals that the canonical precision tests share structural features that render them, 
    as currently configured, unable to directly distinguish between general relativity and certain classes of alternatives, 
    including the Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP).

<h3>1.1 The Textbook Narrative</h3>

    these experiments were performed correctly, but what they actually test.
</p>

<h3>1.2 The Central Question</h3>

<p>
    This paper asks: What do precision tests of relativity actually constrain?
</p>

<p>
    The analysis identifies five structural limitations shared by the experimental canon:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <em>Two-Way Measurement Dominance:</em> Nearly all tests use round-trip or 
        reciprocity-even measurements, which are mathematically blind to direction-dependent effects.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Local/Global Conflation:</em> Tests of local Lorentz invariance are extrapolated 
        to claims about global spacetime structure.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Model-Dependent Calibration:</em> Systems like GPS use GR-derived corrections to validate GR—
        demonstrating self-consistency within the framework, not independent confirmation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>The Conformal Loophole:</em> Multi-messenger constraints bound the disformal 
        sector of scalar-tensor theories while leaving the conformal sector unconstrained.
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Theory-Laden Data Reduction:</em> Systematic corrections assume the framework 
        being tested, making independent falsification practically difficult within standard pipelines.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    These limitations do not invalidate the experiments. They indicate that, in many cases, the tests primarily constrain 
    parameter space within an assumed framework rather than systematically discriminating between alternatives.
</p>

<p>
    The analysis throughout assumes a regime where disformal cone tilts are already constrained by multi-messenger bounds, and focuses on clock-sector structure that remains unconstrained within those limits.
</p>

<div class="scope-box">
    <h4>Scope of Claim</h4>
    <p>
        This manuscript does not dispute the validity of canonical precision tests within their modeled domains. 
        It argues that many flagship tests primarily constrain reciprocity-even (two-way / closed-path) observables 
        and therefore may not discriminate GR from a class of two-metric disformal scalar-tensor frameworks that reproduce 
        local redshift and round-trip light-time relations. Discrimination requires observables that are 
        offset-invariant yet one-way and direction-reversing, or that probe spatial clock-correlation structure.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>1.3 The Temporal Equivalence Principle: Theory Definition</h3>

<p>
    The Temporal Equivalence Principle (TEP) is defined formally by a single manifold endowed with two metrics and a universal matter coupling. It is not an ad hoc modification but a systematic framework for dynamical time.
</p>

<div class="key-concept">
    <h4>Formal Definition</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Sector map:</strong> The conformal factor A(φ) governs clock rates and spatial correlation structure; 
        the disformal factor B(φ) governs light-cone tilts and residual holonomy. GW170817 constrains the disformal 
        sector; the conformal sector remains unconstrained by single-path multi-messenger observations.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>1. The Action:</strong> The theory is defined in the Einstein frame ($g_{\mu\nu}$) by:</p>
    <div class="equation">
        $$S = \int d^4x \sqrt{-g} \left[ \frac{M_{Pl}^2}{2} R - \frac{1}{2} (\partial\phi)^2 - V(\phi) \right] + S_{matter}[\psi, \tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}]$$
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>2. The Metrics:</strong> Gravity is governed by $g_{\mu\nu}$. All matter fields $\psi$ and clocks couple universally to the <em>matter metric</em> $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$, related by a disformal map:</p>
    <div class="equation">
        $$\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A(\phi) g_{\mu\nu} + B(\phi) \partial_\mu\phi \partial_\nu\phi$$
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>3. The Coupling:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clocks:</strong> Ideal clocks measure proper time $\tau$ defined by $d\tau^2 = -\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu$.</li>
        <li><strong>Light:</strong> Photons propagate on null geodesics of $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$. (In the conformal limit $B=0$, these coincide with $g_{\mu\nu}$ null geodesics).</li>
        <li><strong>Test Particles:</strong> Massive bodies follow geodesics of $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    The key distinguishing predictions are therefore not local redshift or two-way light-time relations 
    (where TEP can agree with GR), but global and statistical observables that probe synchronization 
    integrability and spatial structure:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Local physics is identical to GR in freely falling laboratories (EEP; locally invariant c)</li>
    <li>Clock residuals can exhibit spatially structured correlations (e.g., exponential decay with distance) if the scalar field has a finite correlation length</li>
    <li>A convention-independent residual synchronization holonomy H<sub>resid</sub> can be defined for direction-reversing, one-way closed loops after subtracting modeled GR loop effects</li>
    <li>Light and gravitational-wave propagation remain consistent with existing constraints: conformal rescaling preserves null cones, and any disformal cone tilt is bounded at the 10<sup>−15</sup> level</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The existing experimental canon strongly constrains local Lorentz violation, PPN departures in the 
    gravitational/light-propagation sector, and disformal cone tilts. It does not yet directly probe 
    spatial clock-correlation structure or residual holonomy in genuinely one-way, direction-reversing 
    closed loops.
</p>

<div class="key-insight">
    <h4>Candidate Discriminators and Current Status</h4>
    <p>
        To ensure falsifiability, TEP specifies candidate observables where it can differ from GR. Where numerical values are quoted from the TEP research program, they are treated as reported results requiring independent replication.

    <p>
        Critical note: The first three observables target conformal-sector structure associated with A(φ), while the holonomy test targets disformal structure associated with B(φ). The core argument of this paper concerns measurement geometry and does not assume that any specific GNSS-reported numerical value is correct.

<h3>1.4 Structure of This Paper</h3>

<p>
    Section 2 develops the methodological framework for analyzing precision tests, introducing 
    key distinctions between gauge-invariant and convention-dependent observables, two-way 
    and one-way measurements, and local and global tests.
</p>

<p>
    Sections 3–7 examine the major categories of precision tests:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Section 3: Gravitational redshift tests (Pound-Rebka, optical clocks)</li>
    <li>Section 4: Time dilation tests (Hafele-Keating, GPS)</li>
    <li>Section 5: Light propagation tests (Shapiro delay, VLBI)</li>
    <li>Section 6: Multi-messenger constraints (GW170817)</li>
    <li>Section 7: Resonator tests (Michelson-Morley, cavity experiments)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Section 8 proposes experiments that could genuinely discriminate between GR and TEP: 
    triangle holonomy tests, interplanetary closed-loop timing, and GNSS correlation replication.
</p>

<p>
    Section 9 discusses the philosophical implications, situating the findings within the 
    broader context of underdetermination in physics. Section 10 concludes.
</p>

<h3>1.5 Related Work</h3>

<p>
    This analysis builds upon and extends several distinct strands of literature in gravitational 
    physics, metrology, and the philosophy of science.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Test Theories of Relativity:</strong> Frameworks for testing Lorentz invariance, such as the 
    Mansouri-Sexl (1977) formalism and the Standard Model Extension (SME) (Colladay &amp; Kostelecký 1998), 
    have long parameterized deviations from relativity. These frameworks primarily focus on local Lorentz 
    violation (anisotropy, boost dependence) in single-metric contexts. TEP differs by accepting exact 
    local Lorentz invariance (consistent with the tightest SME bounds) while introducing non-integrable 
    synchronization structure via a second metric.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Relativistic Metrology:</strong> The distinction between one-way and two-way time transfer is 
    foundational in metrology (Ashby 2003). While two-way satellite time and frequency transfer 
    (TWSTFT) and GPS Common-View are standard techniques for clock comparison, they are explicitly designed 
    to cancel path delays. Recent proposals for "relativistic geodesy" with optical clocks (Mehlstäubler et al. 2018) 
    focus on measuring the geopotential $W$, assuming GR. This work explores the inverse problem: using clocks 
    to test the framework that defines $W$.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Philosophy of Simultaneity:</strong> The conventionality of simultaneity (Reichenbach 1928; Grünbaum 1973; 
    Salmon 1977) establishes that one-way light speed is a convention in special relativity. Malament (1977) 
    argued that causal connectivity makes standard synchronization unique, but this uniqueness holds only 
    if the causal structure is singular (one metric). This paper operationalizes these philosophical insights 
    in the context of two-metric theories, where the interplay between causal (light) and temporal (clock) 
    structures makes the "convention" physically testable via holonomy.
</p>

<p>
    Theory-Laden Experimentation: The challenge of "epistemological circularity" in precision 
    tests—where data reduction relies on the theory being tested—has been discussed by Franklin (1986) and 
    others. This analysis extends that discussion to modern precision cosmology and GNSS data processing, identifying 
    specific pipelines (e.g., common-mode filtering) that enforce theoretical priors.
</p>

<p>
    To forestall misunderstanding, this paper does not claim:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>That GR is wrong</li>
    <li>That precision tests are flawed or incompetent</li>
    <li>That TEP is correct</li>
    <li>That all alternatives to GR are viable</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The claim is narrower and more specific: the existing experimental canon does not directly probe 
    the observables that distinguish GR from TEP. This underdetermination is resolvable through new experimental 
    configurations that have not yet been performed.
</p>
