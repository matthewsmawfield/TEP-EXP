<h2>2. Methodological Framework</h2>

<p>
    Before examining individual experiments, it is essential to establish the conceptual tools 
    required to distinguish what precision tests actually measure from what they are commonly 
    claimed to measure. This section develops four key distinctions that structure the subsequent analysis.
</p>

<h3>2.1 Gauge-Invariant vs. Convention-Dependent Observables</h3>

<p>
    Not all physical quantities carry the same epistemological weight. A fundamental distinction 
    exists between gauge-invariant observables—quantities that remain unchanged under coordinate 
    transformations—and convention-dependent quantities that depend on arbitrary choices.
</p>

<div class="key-concept">
    <h4>Definition 2.1: Gauge-Invariant Observable</h4>
    <p>
        An observable O is gauge-invariant if and only if its value is independent of the 
        coordinate system, synchronization convention, or reference frame used to compute it.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    Examples of gauge-invariant observables include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Proper time elapsed along a worldline: τ = ∫ ds</li>
    <li>Round-trip light travel time between two events</li>
    <li>Frequency ratio of co-located clocks</li>
    <li>Interference fringe count in closed optical paths</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Examples of convention-dependent quantities include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>One-way speed of light (depends on synchronization)</li>
    <li>Coordinate time difference between spatially separated events</li>
    <li>Simultaneity of distant events</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The critical insight is that most precision tests measure gauge-invariant quantities, 
    which by construction do not directly probe the specific loop and correlation observables 
    that differ between GR and TEP in the regime considered here.
</p>

<p>
    The central claim of this paper is that most high-precision tests to date access only the 
    gauge-invariant subset of observables on which GR and TEP explicitly agree.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Two-Way vs. One-Way Measurements</h3>

<p>
    The distinction between two-way (round-trip) and one-way measurements is not merely 
    technical but fundamental to what can be tested.
</p>

<div class="key-concept">
    <h4>The Reichenbach Synchronization Problem</h4>
    <p>
        The one-way speed of light cannot be measured without first establishing a 
        synchronization convention between spatially separated clocks. But any synchronization 
        convention presupposes a one-way speed of light. This circularity means the one-way 
        speed is convention-dependent, not empirically determinable.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    Two-way measurements avoid this circularity by using a single clock:
</p>

<div class="equation">$$t_{\text{round-trip}} = t_{\text{return}} - t_{\text{emit}} \quad \text{(single clock, gauge-invariant)}$$</div>

<p>
    However, this gauge-invariance comes at a cost: two-way measurements are inherently 
    insensitive to direction-dependent effects. If light travels at c + v in one direction 
    and c − v in the return direction, the round-trip time is:
</p>

<div class="equation">$$t_{RT} = \frac{L}{c+v} + \frac{L}{c-v} = \frac{2Lc}{c^2 - v^2} \approx \frac{2L}{c} + O\left(\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)$$</div>

<p>
    The first-order direction-dependent term cancels exactly. This is not a limitation of 
    experimental precision but a mathematical necessity: round-trip measurements are 
    reciprocity-even and cannot probe reciprocity-odd effects.
</p>

<h3>2.3 Local vs. Global Tests</h3>

<p>
    A second crucial distinction separates local tests—performed within a single freely 
    falling frame—from global tests that probe the structure of spacetime across extended regions.
</p>

<div class="key-concept">
    <h4>The Equivalence Principle Hierarchy</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP):</em> All bodies fall with the same acceleration in a gravitational field.</li>
        <li><em>Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP):</em> In local freely falling frames, non-gravitational physics is Lorentz-invariant.</li>
        <li><em>Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP):</em> EEP extends to gravitational physics; local gravitational experiments are position-independent.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    The TEP framework satisfies EEP exactly: in local freely falling frames, physics reduces 
    to special relativity with invariant c. This means local tests—no matter how precise—cannot 
    distinguish TEP from GR. The distinction arises in global and statistical observables: spatial structure 
    in clock residuals and a GR-subtracted residual holonomy H<sub>resid</sub> defined by genuinely one-way, 
    direction-reversing closed loops.
</p>

<p>
    The operational criterion for "local" is whether the measurement region is small compared 
    to the curvature scale. Modern optical clock experiments operate at millimeter scales 
    where spacetime curvature is negligible—they are quintessentially local tests.
</p>

<h3>2.4 Single-Path vs. Multipath Configurations</h3>

<p>
    The final distinction concerns whether signals traverse a single path or multiple paths 
    through spacetime.
</p>

<div class="key-concept">
    <h4>Common-Mode Cancellation</h4>
    <p>
        When two signals traverse the same path, any path-dependent effects cancel in their 
        comparison. This is why GW170817—where photons and gravitons traveled the same 
        ~130 million light-year path—constrains only their differential propagation speed, 
        not their common-mode time dilation.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    TEP phenomenology arises from:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Multipath configurations (gravitational lensing, where rays sample different field values)</li>
    <li>Statistical correlations (GNSS, where spatial structure ⟨φ(x)φ(x')⟩ is probed)</li>
    <li>Closed loops with direction reversal (residual holonomy H<sub>resid</sub> after subtracting modeled GR loop effects)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Single-path, single-direction measurements—the dominant mode of precision tests—are 
    structurally incapable of detecting these signatures.
</p>

            <td>Absolute synchronization</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>One-way, closed-loop</td>
            <td>Invariant</td>

            <td>—</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
    The final row—one-way closed-loop measurements—represents the only configuration capable 
    of testing synchronization integrability. No high-precision relativistic-gravity test has 
    directly targeted a convention-independent, direction-reversing, one-way loop observable 
    designed to detect non-integrable synchronization beyond modeled GR terms.
