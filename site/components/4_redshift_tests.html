<h2>3. The Gravitational Redshift Tests</h2>

<p>
    Gravitational redshift experiments—from Pound-Rebka (1960) to modern optical lattice clocks—are 
    often cited as the most precise confirmations of general relativity. This section examines what 
    these experiments actually test and why they do not directly probe the observables that distinguish GR from TEP.
</p>

<h3>3.1 The Canonical Experiments</h3>

<h4>3.1.1 Pound-Rebka-Snider (1960-1965)</h4>

<p>
    The Pound-Rebka experiment measured the gravitational redshift of 14.4 keV gamma rays 
    traveling 22.5 meters vertically in the Jefferson Tower at Harvard. The observed fractional 
    frequency shift:
</p>

<div class="equation">$$\frac{\Delta\nu}{\nu} = \frac{gh}{c^2} = \frac{(9.8 \text{ m/s}^2)(22.5 \text{ m})}{(3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})^2} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-15}$$</div>

<p>
    agreed with the GR prediction to within 1% (later improved to 0.1% by Pound and Snider).
</p>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>Methodological Analysis</h4>
    <p>
        The experiment compares the frequency of gamma rays emitted at height h₁ with those 
        absorbed at height h₂. Both emission and absorption occur locally—the comparison is 
        between two local measurements connected by light propagation.
    </p>
    <p>
        TEP predicts identical local physics in freely falling frames. The gravitational 
        redshift arises from the difference in gravitational potential between emission and 
        absorption points—a prediction shared by any metric theory satisfying EEP.
    </p>
</div>

<h4>3.1.2 Gravity Probe A (1976)</h4>

<p>
    Gravity Probe A flew a hydrogen maser to 10,000 km altitude, comparing its frequency 
    with ground-based masers. The experiment confirmed gravitational time dilation to 
    7 × 10⁻⁵ relative precision.
</p>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>Methodological Analysis</h4>
    <p>
        The comparison used two-way microwave links: signals were sent up to the spacecraft 
        and transponded back. The round-trip nature of the measurement makes it insensitive 
        to any direction-dependent propagation effects.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experiment confirms that clocks at different gravitational potentials run at 
        different rates—a prediction common to GR, TEP, and all metric theories of gravity.
    </p>
</div>

<h4>3.1.3 Modern Optical Lattice Clocks (2010-present)</h4>

<p>
    Jun Ye's group at JILA has achieved gravitational redshift measurements at the 
    10<sup>−18</sup> level and below, detecting time dilation across millimeter height differences. 
    These represent the most precise measurements of gravitational effects ever performed.
</p>

<div class="key-quote">
    <blockquote>
        "We greatly benefit from rejection of common-mode systematic shifts thanks to 
        ensembles sharing the same optical lattice."
        <cite>— Bothwell et al. (2022)</cite>
    </blockquote>
</div>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>Methodological Analysis</h4>
    <p>
        The quoted statement reveals the experimental configuration: clock ensembles share 
        the same optical lattice, enabling common-mode rejection. This is a local comparison 
        within a single laboratory frame.
    </p>
    <p>
        The measurement scale (millimeters) is vastly smaller than any curvature scale. 
        These are quintessentially local tests of the equivalence principle, not probes of 
        global spacetime structure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Optical clock metrology also includes long-baseline comparisons (for example via phase-stabilized fiber links) used for relativistic geodesy and time-scale realization. These experiments extend the baseline, but they still primarily target reciprocity-even observables such as frequency ratios and potential differences, and they typically rely on link designs and models that suppress non-reciprocal path terms.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result, even when baselines extend to regional or continental scales, the dominant observable remains a redshift-type comparison rather than a direction-reversing closed-loop residual holonomy H<sub>resid</sub> or a deliberately constructed spatial correlation statistic.
    </p>
    <p>
        TEP Axiom 2 states: "In local freely falling frames, physics reduces exactly to 
        special relativity with invariant c." These experiments confirm this axiom—they 
        cannot test whether synchronization is globally integrable.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>3.2 What Redshift Tests Actually Measure</h3>

<p>
    All gravitational redshift experiments measure the same fundamental quantity: the ratio 
    of proper times at different gravitational potentials.
</p>

<div class="equation">$$\frac{d\tau_1}{d\tau_2} = \sqrt{\frac{g_{00}(x_1)}{g_{00}(x_2)}} \approx 1 + \frac{\Phi_1 - \Phi_2}{c^2}$$</div>

<p>
    This ratio is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Gauge-invariant (independent of coordinate choice)</li>
    <li>Local (compares clocks at specific spacetime points)</li>
    <li>Common to all metric theories satisfying EEP</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The experiments do not measure:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Absolute synchronization between distant clocks</li>
    <li>Path-dependence of clock transport</li>
    <li>Global integrability of the synchronization field</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3 The ACES Mission: A Missed Opportunity?</h3>

<p>
    The Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space (ACES), scheduled for the International Space Station, 
    will compare space-based and ground-based atomic clocks with unprecedented precision. 
    The mission aims to test gravitational redshift at the 2–3 × 10<sup>−6</sup> level (Savalle et al. 2019).
</p>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>Configuration Analysis</h4>
    <p>
        ACES uses microwave and optical links for clock comparison. The microwave link 
        (MWL) employs two-way time transfer—signals travel up and down, with the comparison 
        derived from the round-trip.
    </p>
    <p>
        While ACES will achieve remarkable precision, its two-way configuration makes it 
        structurally incapable of detecting synchronization holonomy. The experiment will 
        confirm (or constrain) the gravitational redshift formula but cannot test whether 
        synchronization is path-dependent.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>3.4 Summary: Local Brilliance, Global Blindness</h3>

<div class="summary-box">
    <h4>What Gravitational Redshift Tests Confirm</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Clocks at different gravitational potentials run at different rates</li>
        <li>The rate difference follows dτ/dt = √(1 + 2Φ/c²) to extraordinary precision</li>
        <li>Local Lorentz invariance holds at the 10<sup>−18</sup> level</li>
        <li>The Einstein Equivalence Principle is satisfied</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>What They Cannot Test</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Whether synchronization is globally integrable</li>
        <li>Whether clock transport around closed loops accumulates holonomy</li>
        <li>Whether the one-way speed of light is direction-independent</li>
        <li>Any prediction that distinguishes GR from TEP</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    The gravitational redshift tests are triumphs of experimental physics. They confirm 
    that gravity affects time—a revolutionary insight that transformed our understanding 
    of the universe. These experiments were not designed to probe global synchronization 
    structure, and it would be unreasonable to criticize them for not testing something 
    outside their scope. The point is simply that theories agreeing on local physics 
    (like GR and TEP) do not directly probe the specific loop and correlation observables 
    that differ between them in the regime considered here.
</p>

<p>
    The proposed loop and correlation experiments should therefore be seen as complementary 
    additions to, not replacements for, the existing experimental canon.
