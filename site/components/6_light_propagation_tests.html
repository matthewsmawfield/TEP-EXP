<h2>5. The Light Propagation Tests</h2>

<p>
    Light propagation experiments—Shapiro delay measurements, VLBI observations, and 
    gravitational lensing studies—probe how electromagnetic radiation traverses curved 
    spacetime. These tests have achieved remarkable precision in constraining the 
    Parameterized Post-Newtonian (PPN) parameter γ. This section examines what these 
    constraints actually imply.
</p>

<h3>5.1 The Shapiro Delay</h3>

<p>
    In 1964, Irwin Shapiro predicted that radar signals passing near the Sun would 
    experience a time delay due to spacetime curvature. The "fourth test of GR" has 
    since been measured with increasing precision.
</p>

<h4>5.1.1 The Cassini Experiment (2003)</h4>

<p>
    The most precise Shapiro delay measurement used radio signals between Earth and the 
    Cassini spacecraft during solar conjunction. The result:
</p>

<div class="equation">$$\gamma = 1 + (2.1 \pm 2.3) \times 10^{-5}$$</div>

<p>
    This constrains the PPN parameter γ to agree with GR (γ = 1) at the 10⁻⁵ level.
</p>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>Methodological Analysis</h4>
    <p>
        The Cassini measurement used round-trip radio ranging: signals were transmitted 
        from Earth to the spacecraft and transponded back. The measured quantity is the 
        round-trip light time, not the one-way propagation time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Round-trip measurements are inherently reciprocity-even. If the one-way speed of 
        light differs in opposite directions (c + δ outbound, c − δ inbound), the round-trip 
        time is:
    </p>
    <div class="equation">$$t_{RT} = \frac{L}{c+\delta} + \frac{L}{c-\delta} = \frac{2Lc}{c^2 - \delta^2} \approx \frac{2L}{c} + O\left(\frac{\delta^2}{c^2}\right)$$</div>
    <p>
        The first-order direction-dependent term cancels exactly. Cassini constrains 
        reciprocity-even effects (the PPN γ parameter) but is blind to reciprocity-odd 
        effects (direction-dependent propagation).
    </p>
</div>

<h4>5.1.2 Data Reduction Concerns</h4>

<p>
    The Cassini analysis required extensive corrections for systematic effects:
</p>

<div class="key-quote">
    <blockquote>
        "Doppler calibration for Earth's troposphere... potential major error source. 
        We multiply y by downlink X-Band frequency... make new file for further processing."
        <cite>— Bertotti, Iess, and Tortora (2003)</cite>
    </blockquote>
</div>

<p>
    The Cassini inference is conditional on an end-to-end modeling stack: a spacetime model for signal 
    propagation in the solar system, together with tropospheric, plasma, and spacecraft dynamics models. 
    This does not weaken the measurement; it clarifies what is being tested. The result tightly constrains 
    γ within the assumed signal model class.
</p>

<h3>5.2 Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)</h3>

<p>
    VLBI observations of quasars near the Sun measure the apparent deflection of radio 
    waves by solar gravity. The deflection angle:
</p>

<div class="equation">$$\theta = (1 + \gamma) \times \frac{2GM}{c^2 b}$$</div>

<p>
    where b is the impact parameter, has been measured to constrain γ at the 10⁻⁴ level.
</p>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>Methodological Analysis</h4>
    <p>
        VLBI measures the differential arrival time of radio waves at widely separated 
        antennas. The measurement is sensitive to the angular position of the source, 
        which shifts due to gravitational light bending.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like Shapiro delay, this constrains the conformal factor in the metric (how 
        spatial distances are modified by gravity) but not the synchronization structure. 
        The PPN γ parameter appears in the spatial part of the metric; synchronization 
        holonomy arises from the temporal part.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>5.3 The PPN Framework and Its Limitations</h3>

<p>
    The Parameterized Post-Newtonian formalism provides a systematic way to compare 
    metric theories of gravity. The PPN metric in isotropic coordinates:
</p>

<div class="equation">$$ds^2 = -(1 - 2U + 2\beta U^2)c^2 dt^2 + (1 + 2\gamma U)(dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2)$$</div>

<p>
    where U = GM/rc² is the Newtonian potential. GR predicts β = γ = 1.
</p>

<h4>5.3.1 What PPN Tests Constrain</h4>

<ul>
    <li><em>γ:</em> How much space curvature is produced by unit rest mass</li>
    <li><em>β:</em> How much nonlinearity exists in the superposition of gravity</li>
    <li><em>Other parameters:</em> Preferred-frame effects, conservation law violations</li>
</ul>

<h4>5.3.2 What PPN Tests Cannot Constrain</h4>

<p>
    The PPN framework parameterizes the post-Newtonian limit under the assumption that the same effective 
    metric governs the sector being tested (typically solar-system dynamics and light propagation). It is 
    therefore not a complete language for theories in which additional structure appears in the matter and 
    clock sector while remaining effectively GR-like in the photon and gravitational sectors.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Clock transport and synchronization are governed by an effective metric distinct from the one constrained by light-propagation observables</li>
    <li>Convention-independent loop observables (residual holonomy after GR subtraction) are the primary targets</li>
    <li>Non-local statistical structure appears in clock residuals (spatial correlations) rather than in PPN light-bending parameters</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In TEP, the matter metric is related to the gravitational metric by a disformal map 
    g̃<sub>μν</sub> = A(φ)g<sub>μν</sub> + B(φ)∇<sub>μ</sub>φ∇<sub>ν</sub>φ. The conformal factor A(φ) 
    rescales the matter sector while preserving null cones; the disformal term B(φ) can tilt null cones and 
    is strongly constrained by multi-messenger observations. Consequently, PPN light-propagation tests can 
    leave room for clock-sector effects encoded in A(φ) and for loop/correlation observables that are not 
    representable as a single γ parameter.
</p>

<h3>5.4 The Conformal vs. Disformal Distinction</h3>

<p>
    In scalar-tensor theories, the physical metric can differ from the gravitational 
    metric through conformal and disformal transformations:
</p>

<div class="equation">$$\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu} = A(\phi)g_{\mu\nu} + B(\phi)\partial_\mu\phi \partial_\nu\phi$$</div>

<p>
    where A(φ) is the conformal factor and B(φ) is the disformal factor.
</p>

<div class="key-concept">
    <h4>The Conformal Loophole</h4>
    <p>
        Light propagation tests constrain the combination of conformal and disformal 
        couplings that affects null geodesics. But conformal transformations preserve 
        the null cone structure—light rays follow the same paths regardless of A(φ).
    </p>
    <p>
        In a two-metric framework, A(φ) can modify clock rates (and hence clock residual statistics) while 
        remaining invisible to light-bending and Shapiro-delay measurements. By contrast, any disformal cone 
        tilt sourced by B(φ) is directly constrained. Light-propagation tests therefore do not directly probe 
        spatial clock-correlation structure or residual loop observables, even when they tightly bound B(φ).
    </p>
</div>

<h3>5.5 Summary: Constraining a Different Sector</h3>

<div class="summary-box">
    <h4>What Light Propagation Tests Confirm</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>PPN γ = 1 to 10⁻⁵ precision</li>
        <li>Light bending follows GR predictions</li>
        <li>Shapiro delay matches GR to high accuracy</li>
        <li>No evidence for preferred-frame effects in light propagation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>What They Cannot Test</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Conformal coupling to matter/clocks (preserves null cone)</li>
        <li>Synchronization structure (requires one-way measurements)</li>
        <li>Direction-dependent propagation (cancels in round-trip)</li>
        <li>Clock-sector effects and loop/correlation observables that are not reducible to PPN light-propagation parameters</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    Light propagation tests are precision triumphs that tightly constrain the post-Newtonian light-propagation sector 
    (e.g., γ ≈ 1) and place strong limits on any disformal cone tilt (encoded in B(φ)). These constraints are 
    largely orthogonal to clock-sector observables such as spatially structured correlations in clock residuals and 
    GR-subtracted residual holonomy H<sub>resid</sub>, which require genuinely one-way, direction-reversing configurations.
