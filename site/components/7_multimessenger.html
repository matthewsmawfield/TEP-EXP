<h2>6. The Multi-Messenger Constraints</h2>

<p>
    The event GW170817 detected gravitational waves from a binary neutron star merger, 
    followed (+1.74 ± 0.05) s later by a gamma-ray burst (GRB 170817A). This timing coincidence yields an 
    assumption-dependent constraint on the fractional speed difference between gravitational waves and light.
</p>

<h3>6.1 The GW170817 Event</h3>

<p>
    On August 17, 2017, the LIGO-Virgo collaboration detected gravitational waves from 
    a binary neutron star inspiral in NGC 4993, with luminosity distance of order 40 Mpc (130 million light-years; conservative bounds use the lower end of the distance interval) 
    distant. The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor detected GRB 170817A approximately (+1.74 ± 0.05) s 
    after the gravitational wave signal.
</p>

<h4>6.1.1 The Speed Constraint</h4>

<p>
    Interpreting the observed delay as (at least partially) a propagation-time difference yields a bound on the 
    fractional speed difference during the trip.
</p>

<div class="equation">$$-3\times 10^{-15} \lesssim \frac{c_g - c_\gamma}{c} \lesssim 7\times 10^{-16}$$</div>

<p>
    The numerical bounds depend on conservative assumptions about intrinsic emission-time offsets between the 
    gravitational-wave and gamma-ray signals. In particular, the observable directly constrains differential 
    propagation, while the emission-time difference is astrophysically model dependent (Abbott et al. 2017).
</p>

<h4>6.1.2 The Standard Interpretation</h4>

<p>
    The constraint has been used to rule out or severely constrain numerous modified 
    gravity theories, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Scalar-tensor theories with disformal coupling</li>
    <li>Massive gravity theories</li>
    <li>Lorentz-violating gravity theories</li>
    <li>Certain dark energy models</li>
</ul>

<h3>6.2 What GW170817 Actually Constrains</h3>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>The Single-Path Problem</h4>
    <p>
        Both gravitational waves and gamma rays traveled the same path through spacetime 
        from NGC 4993 to Earth. Any effect that modifies propagation along this path 
        affects both signals identically.
    </p>
    <p>
        The measurement constrains the differential propagation speed—how much faster 
        or slower gravitational waves travel compared to light along the same path. It 
        does not constrain effects that modify both signals equally.
    </p>
</div>

<h4>6.2.1 The Conformal Loophole: Explicit Formulation</h4>

<p>
    Understanding why GW170817 does not directly constrain TEP's conformal sector requires examining the two-metric 
    structure explicitly. This section provides the mathematical derivation that shows 
    conformal coupling cancels in arrival-time comparisons.
</p>

<div class="key-concept">
    <h4>The Two-Metric Structure</h4>
    <p>
        In scalar-tensor theories like TEP, spacetime has two metrics:
    </p>
    
    <p>Gravitational metric (Einstein frame):</p>
    <div class="equation">$$g_{\mu\nu}^{\text{GW}} = g_{\mu\nu}$$</div>
    <p>Gravitational waves propagate on null geodesics of this metric.</p>
    
    <p>Electromagnetic metric (Jordan frame):</p>
    <div class="equation">$$g_{\mu\nu}^{\text{EM}} = A(\phi) g_{\mu\nu}^{\text{GW}} + B(\phi) \nabla_\mu\phi \nabla_\nu\phi$$</div>
    <p>Photons propagate on null geodesics of this metric.</p>
    
    <p>
        The conformal factor A(φ) = exp(2βφ/M<sub>Pl</sub>) rescales the metric uniformly. 
        The disformal factor B(φ) introduces direction-dependent modifications.
    </p>
</div>

<h4>6.2.2 The Flight Time Calculation</h4>

<p>
    Consider a signal (gravitational wave or photon) traveling from source S to detector D 
    along a null geodesic. The coordinate flight time is:
</p>

<div class="equation">$$T = \int_S^D dt = \int_S^D \frac{dl}{c_{\text{eff}}}$$</div>

<p>
    where c<sub>eff</sub> is the effective propagation speed in the relevant metric.
</p>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>Gravitational Wave Flight Time</h4>
    <p>
        For gravitational waves propagating on g<sub>μν</sub><sup>GW</sup>:
    </p>
    <div class="equation">$$T_{\text{GW}} = \int_S^D \frac{dl}{c}$$</div>
    <p>
        where c is the coordinate speed of light in the Einstein frame.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Photon Flight Time (Conformal Only, B = 0)</h4>
    <p>
        For photons propagating on $g_{\mu\nu}^{\text{EM}} = A(\phi) g_{\mu\nu}^{\text{GW}}$:
    </p>
    <div class="equation">$$T_\gamma = \int_S^D \frac{\sqrt{A(\phi)} \, dl}{c \times \sqrt{A(\phi)}} = \int_S^D \frac{dl}{c} = T_{\text{GW}}$$</div>
    <p>
        The conformal factor A(φ) cancels in the differential time-of-flight observable under specific operational assumptions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Co-spatial Endpoints:</strong> Source S and Detector D are identical for both signals.</li>
        <li><strong>Same Clock Standards:</strong> The flight time is measured using the same matter-sector clock definition at the detector.</li>
        <li><strong>Null Path Invariance:</strong> Conformal transformations preserve the null character of geodesics ($ds^2 = 0 \iff A ds^2 = 0$).</li>
        <li><strong>Emission-Time Nuisance:</strong> Intrinsic emission delays are treated as nuisance parameters to be modeled or marginalized.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Under these conditions, the observed EM–GW arrival-time difference is insensitive to purely conformal rescalings of the metric along the shared path. The empirical constraint therefore applies to differential propagation effects (for example, disformal cone tilts), not to common-mode rescalings.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="key-insight">
    <h4>Why Conformal Coupling Cancels</h4>
    <p>
        Under a conformal transformation g̃<sub>μν</sub> = A(φ)g<sub>μν</sub>:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Null geodesics remain null:</strong> If g<sub>μν</sub>k<sup>μ</sup>k<sup>ν</sup> = 0, 
            then g̃<sub>μν</sub>k<sup>μ</sup>k<sup>ν</sup> = A(φ) × 0 = 0</li>
        <li><strong>Path length scales:</strong> dl̃ = √A(φ) dl</li>
        <li><strong>Coordinate speed scales:</strong> c̃ = √A(φ) c</li>
        <li><strong>Flight time invariant:</strong> T̃ = dl̃/c̃ = dl/c = T</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This cancellation concerns the differential arrival-time observable for two signals that follow the same null trajectory and are time-stamped by the same detector clock standard. In that configuration, a purely conformal rescaling does not generate a measurable EM–GW time-of-flight difference.
    </p>
</div>

<h4>6.2.3 The Disformal Contribution</h4>

<p>
    The disformal term B(φ)∇<sub>μ</sub>φ∇<sub>ν</sub>φ does modify the relative propagation:
</p>

<div class="equation">$$c_\gamma^2 = c^2 \left[1 - \frac{B(\phi)(\partial\phi)^2}{A(\phi)}\right] \quad \text{(schematic parameterization)}$$</div>

<p>
    This introduces a genuine speed difference:
</p>

<div class="equation">$$\Delta T = T_\gamma - T_{\text{GW}} \approx \frac{D}{c} \times \frac{B(\phi)(\partial\phi)^2}{A(\phi)}$$</div>

<p>
    GW170817's observed coincidence (after accounting for astrophysical emission-time uncertainties) implies that any net differential propagation delay accumulated over the propagation distance must be small. Operationally, the observation bounds the fractional speed difference at the few × 10<sup>−15</sup> level under standard emission-time assumptions.
</p>

<p>
    This is a real constraint on the disformal sector. It does not directly constrain the conformal factor A(φ) alone.
</p>

    <p>
        In a two-metric framework, the conformal factor A(φ) can modify matter-sector proper-time standards 
        and thereby support spatial structure in clock residuals, while remaining invisible to single-path 
        EM–GW arrival-time comparisons. By contrast, any disformal cone tilt sourced by B(φ) produces a 
        differential propagation effect and is therefore directly constrained by GW170817. A residual 
        synchronization holonomy beyond modeled GR loop effects (H<sub>resid</sub>) vanishes in the 
        conformal-only limit (B = 0) and would require non-exact structure such as B(φ) ≠ 0 or more general 
        non-metricity.
    </p>
</div>

<h4>6.2.4 The Common-Mode Cancellation</h4>

<p>
    GW170817-type constraints compare two signals that traverse essentially the same spacetime path and are 
    time-stamped by clocks in the matter sector at the detector. Any common-mode rescaling of the local 
    proper-time standard cannot be isolated by an EM–GW arrival-time comparison along a single path. The 
    observable is therefore primarily sensitive to differential propagation effects, such as a disformal 
    cone tilt.
</p>

<h3>6.3 What Would Constrain Clock-Sector Structure?</h3>

<p>
    To constrain clock-sector structure (including spatial correlations) and to test for non-exact time transport 
    beyond modeled GR loop effects, one needs measurements that do not reduce to single-path, common-mode comparisons:
</p>

<h4>6.3.1 Multipath Configurations</h4>

<p>
    Gravitational lensing produces multiple images that traverse different paths through 
    the scalar field. If A(φ) varies spatially, different images experience different 
    time delays—the "Shapiro delay" generalized to scalar fields.
</p>

<p>
    This is the origin of TEP's "phantom mass" prediction: lensing time delays probe 
    the integrated scalar field along different paths, potentially mimicking dark matter.
</p>

<h4>6.3.2 Statistical Correlations</h4>

<p>
    If the scalar field has spatial structure ⟨φ(x)φ(x')⟩ ~ exp(−r/λ), clocks at 
    different locations will exhibit correlated fluctuations. This is the signature 
    suggested by exploratory GNSS analysis—distance-structured correlations in clock behavior.
</p>

<p>
    Single-path measurements like GW170817 do not directly probe this structure because they 
    sample only one realization of the field along one path. The proposed spatial-correlation 
    and loop tests should be seen as complementary additions to, not replacements for, 
    multi-messenger constraints.
</p>

<h4>6.3.3 Closed-Loop Holonomy</h4>

<p>
    The experimentally relevant quantity is a GR-subtracted residual holonomy H<sub>resid</sub>, defined from 
    one-way time transfer around a direction-reversing closed loop after subtracting modeled GR loop effects 
    (Sagnac, Shapiro, and gravito-magnetic contributions). In the conformal-only limit (B = 0), the A(φ) 
    contribution is an exact gradient and yields H<sub>resid</sub> = 0 on simply connected domains; a nonzero 
    residual requires non-exact structure, for example a disformal coupling B(φ) ≠ 0 or more general 
    non-metricity.
</p>

<p>
    No single-path multi-messenger observation can probe H<sub>resid</sub> because the signals travel from 
    source to detector, not around direction-reversing closed loops.
</p>

<h3>6.4 The Broader Multi-Messenger Context</h3>

<h4>6.4.1 Future Events</h4>

<p>
    Additional multi-messenger detections will improve statistics but not change the 
    fundamental limitation: single-path measurements constrain differential propagation, 
    not common-mode effects.
</p>

<h4>6.4.2 Strongly Lensed Events</h4>

<p>
    A gravitationally lensed multi-messenger event would provide genuinely new information. 
    If gravitational waves and electromagnetic signals from the same source arrive via 
    different lensed paths, their relative timing probes the scalar field structure 
    along different trajectories.
</p>

<p>
    Such events are rare but would be transformative for constraining conformal coupling.
</p>

<h3>6.5 Summary: The Disformal Constraint</h3>

<div class="summary-box">
    <h4>What GW170817 Confirms</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Under standard emission-time assumptions, the GW–EM speed difference is bounded at the few × 10⁻¹⁵ level</li>
        <li>Disformal coupling B(φ) is tightly constrained</li>
        <li>Lorentz violation in the gravity sector is bounded</li>
        <li>Massive graviton scenarios are excluded or constrained</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>What It Cannot Test</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Conformal coupling A(φ) (preserves null cone)</li>
        <li>Common-mode time dilation along the path</li>
        <li>Spatial structure of scalar fields</li>
        <li>Synchronization holonomy (requires closed loops)</li>
        <li>Clock-sector correlation structure or residual loop observables (H<sub>resid</sub>)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    GW170817 is a landmark observation that opened the era of multi-messenger astronomy. 
    Its constraints on modified gravity are real and important—for the disformal sector. 
    Single-path EM–GW coincidence measurements primarily constrain differential propagation (for example, disformal cone tilts) 
    and do not directly probe clock-sector correlation structure or GR-subtracted residual holonomy H<sub>resid</sub>, which require 
    multipath or direction-reversing closed-loop configurations. This is a statement about measurement geometry, not 
    a criticism of the remarkable experimental achievement.
