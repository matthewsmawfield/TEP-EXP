<h2>7. The Resonator Tests</h2>

<p>
    Optical and microwave resonator experiments—descendants of the Michelson-Morley 
    experiment—have achieved extraordinary precision in testing Lorentz invariance. 
    Modern cavity experiments constrain anisotropy in the speed of light at the 
    10<sup>−18</sup> level. This section examines the logical structure of these null results.
</p>

<h3>7.1 The Michelson-Morley Experiment (1887)</h3>

<p>
    The Michelson-Morley experiment sought to detect Earth's motion through the 
    luminiferous aether by measuring the difference in light travel time along 
    perpendicular arms of an interferometer. The null result—no fringe shift as 
    the apparatus rotated—is celebrated as disproving the aether and motivating 
    special relativity.
</p>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>Methodological Analysis</h4>
    <p>
        The interferometer measures the round-trip travel time difference between 
        two perpendicular paths. Light travels out and back along each arm, and the 
        interference pattern depends on the path length difference.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a two-way, closed-path measurement. If the one-way speed of light 
        is c + v in one direction and c − v in the opposite direction, the round-trip 
        time is:
    </p>
    <div class="equation">$$t = \frac{L}{c+v} + \frac{L}{c-v} = \frac{2Lc}{c^2 - v^2}$$</div>
    <p>
        The first-order direction-dependent term cancels. The experiment is sensitive 
        only to second-order effects (v²/c²), which special relativity predicts to be 
        exactly compensated by length contraction.
    </p>
</div>

<h4>7.1.1 What Michelson-Morley Actually Tests</h4>

<p>
    The null result confirms that the two-way speed of light is isotropic to high 
    precision. It does not test whether the one-way speed is isotropic—that would 
    require synchronized clocks at the endpoints, introducing the synchronization 
    convention problem.
</p>

<div class="key-concept">
    <h4>The Two-Way Isotropy Theorem</h4>
    <p>
        Any theory in which the round-trip speed of light is c (regardless of 
        direction) will produce a null result in Michelson-Morley type experiments. 
        This includes theories where the one-way speed is anisotropic but the 
        anisotropy cancels in round trips.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>7.2 The Kennedy-Thorndike Experiment (1932)</h3>

<p>
    Kennedy and Thorndike modified the Michelson-Morley setup to have unequal arm 
    lengths, testing whether the interference pattern changed as Earth's velocity 
    varied over the year. The null result constrains time dilation effects.
</p>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>Methodological Analysis</h4>
    <p>
        Like Michelson-Morley, this is a two-way measurement. The unequal arms 
        introduce sensitivity to time dilation (how clock rates depend on velocity), 
        but the measurement remains a comparison of round-trip times.
    </p>
    <p>
        The null result confirms that time dilation and length contraction combine 
        consistently—the Lorentz transformation is self-consistent. It does not 
        probe synchronization structure.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>7.3 Modern Cavity Experiments</h3>

<p>
    Contemporary experiments use cryogenic optical or microwave cavities to achieve 
    extraordinary precision. The resonance frequency of a cavity depends on its 
    length and the speed of light:
</p>

<div class="equation">$$f = \frac{nc}{2L}$$</div>

<p>
    where n is the mode number. By comparing cavities oriented in different directions, 
    or monitoring a single cavity as Earth rotates, anisotropy in c can be constrained.
</p>

<h4>7.3.1 Precision Achievements</h4>

    Modern experiments have achieved constraints on Lorentz violation at remarkable levels:

<h4>7.3.2 The Closed-Path Limitation</h4>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>What Cavities Measure</h4>
    <p>
        A cavity resonance involves light bouncing back and forth between mirrors. 
        The resonance condition f = nc/(2L) averages the forward and backward 
        propagation speeds:
    </p>
    <div class="equation">$$f = \frac{n}{L/c_{\text{forward}} + L/c_{\text{backward}}} = \frac{n \times c_{\text{forward}} \times c_{\text{backward}}}{L(c_{\text{forward}} + c_{\text{backward}})}$$</div>
    <p>
        If c<sub>forward</sub> = c + δ and c<sub>backward</sub> = c − δ, then:
    </p>
    <div class="equation">$$f \approx \frac{nc}{2L} \times \left[1 - \frac{\delta^2}{c^2}\right]$$</div>
    <p>
        The first-order anisotropy cancels. Cavity experiments constrain second-order 
        (and higher) Lorentz violation but are blind to first-order direction-dependent 
        effects.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>7.4 The Standard Model Extension (SME) Framework</h3>

<p>
    Modern Lorentz violation tests are interpreted within the Standard Model Extension, 
    which parameterizes all possible Lorentz-violating terms in the Standard Model 
    Lagrangian. Cavity experiments constrain specific SME coefficients.
</p>

<h4>7.4.1 What SME Tests Constrain</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Anisotropy in the two-way speed of light</li>
    <li>Preferred-frame effects in electromagnetism</li>
    <li>CPT violation in photon propagation</li>
</ul>

<h4>7.4.2 What SME Tests Cannot Constrain</h4>

<ul>
    <li>One-way speed anisotropy (convention-dependent)</li>
    <li>Synchronization structure (requires one-way measurements)</li>
    <li>Effects that preserve two-way isotropy while violating one-way isotropy</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.5 The Sagnac Effect: A Partial Exception</h3>

<p>
    The Sagnac effect—the phase shift in a rotating interferometer—is sometimes 
    cited as measuring one-way light speed. In a rotating ring interferometer, 
    counter-propagating beams accumulate different phases:
</p>

<div class="equation">$$\Delta\Phi = \frac{4\pi A\Omega}{\lambda c}$$</div>

<p>
    where A is the enclosed area and Ω is the rotation rate.
</p>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>The Sagnac Subtlety</h4>
    <p>
        The Sagnac effect does involve direction-dependent propagation, but in a 
        rotating frame. The effect is fully explained by the non-inertial nature 
        of the rotating reference frame—it does not probe one-way light speed in 
        an inertial frame.
    </p>
    <p>
        More importantly, the Sagnac interferometer is still a closed-path device. 
        Both beams traverse the same closed loop (in opposite directions) and 
        recombine at the same point. The measurement is of the path integral 
        ∮ v·dl around the loop, not of one-way propagation.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>7.6 Summary: Isotropy of What, Exactly?</h3>

<div class="summary-box">
    <h4>What Resonator Tests Confirm</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Two-way speed of light is isotropic to 10⁻¹⁸</li>
        <li>No preferred frame in electromagnetic phenomena (two-way)</li>
        <li>Lorentz invariance holds for closed-path measurements</li>
        <li>SME coefficients for photon sector are tightly bounded</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>What They Cannot Test</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>One-way speed isotropy (convention-dependent)</li>
        <li>Synchronization structure (requires separated clocks)</li>
        <li>Effects that cancel in round trips</li>
        <li>TEP predictions (which preserve two-way isotropy)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    The resonator tests confirm that the laws of electromagnetism are the same in 
    all directions—for round-trip measurements. This is a profound constraint on 
    Lorentz violation. But it is not a constraint on synchronization structure, 
    which requires genuinely one-way measurements that resonator experiments cannot provide.
</p>

<p>
    TEP preserves local Lorentz invariance exactly. The scalar field φ modifies 
    clock rates but not light propagation. Resonator experiments, which probe 
    light propagation in closed paths, are structurally incapable of detecting 
    TEP signatures.
