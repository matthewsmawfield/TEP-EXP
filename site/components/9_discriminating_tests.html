<h2>8. What Would Actually Discriminate?</h2>

<p>
    The preceding sections have established that canonical precision tests of GR share 
    common methodological limitations: two-way measurements, local comparisons, single-path 
    configurations, and theory-laden data reduction. This section proposes experiments 
    that could genuinely discriminate between GR and TEP.
</p>

<p>
    The following proposals are ordered by increasing baseline length and technological ambition, 
    from terrestrial triangles to interplanetary loops.
</p>

<h3>8.1 The Triangle Holonomy Test</h3>

<p>
    The most direct test of synchronization integrability is the measurement of holonomy 
    around a closed loop using one-way signals. This test must explicitly distinguish TEP 
    holonomy from the well-known Sagnac effect.
</p>

<h4>8.1.1 Formal Definition: The Loop Observable</h4>

<p>
    The loop observable $H$ is defined operationally as a concrete estimator constructed from time-tagged data. Consider three stations $i \in \{A, B, C\}$ exchanging optical pulses.
</p>

<div class="key-concept">
    <h4>The Estimator</h4>
    <p>
        Let $\tau_i(t)$ be the proper time reading of clock $i$ at coordinate time $t$. A pulse emitted by $A$ at $\tau_A^e$ is received by $B$ at $\tau_B^r$. The raw one-way interval is $\Delta_{AB} = \tau_B^r - \tau_A^e$.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Raw Loop Holonomy is the directional difference of the sum of intervals around the loop:
    </p>
    <div class="equation">
        $$H_{\text{raw}} \equiv \oint_{\circlearrowright} \Delta_{ij} - \oint_{\circlearrowleft} \Delta_{ji} = (\Delta_{AB} + \Delta_{BC} + \Delta_{CA}) - (\Delta_{AC} + \Delta_{CB} + \Delta_{BA})$$
    </div>
</div>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>Decomposition and Invariance</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>1. Invariance to Clock Offsets:</strong> Let each clock have a constant offset $\delta_i$ from coordinate time: $\tau_i(t) = t + \delta_i$. The term $\delta_i$ appears in one emission and one reception term in each direction.
        <br>In $\circlearrowright$: $(\delta_B - \delta_A) + (\delta_C - \delta_B) + (\delta_A - \delta_C) = 0$.
        <br>Thus, $H_{\text{raw}}$ is strictly invariant to constant clock synchronization errors.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>2. Decomposition:</strong> The observable decomposes into physical and systematic terms:
    </p>
    <div class="equation">
        $$H_{\text{raw}} = H_{\text{Sagnac}} + H_{\text{Shapiro}} + H_{\text{GM}} + H_{\text{atm}} + H_{\text{inst}} + H_{\text{TEP}}$$
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>$H_{\text{Sagnac}} \propto \mathbf{\Omega} \cdot \mathbf{A}$: Earth rotation (dominant, $\sim 100$ ns).</li>
        <li>$H_{\text{Shapiro}} \propto \sum GM/r$: Gravitational delay (cancels if path $AB$ same as $BA$, but nonzero if S/C motion makes paths differ).</li>
        <li>$H_{\text{GM}}$: Gravito-magnetic/Lense-Thirring effects ($\sim 10^{-17}$ s).</li>
        <li>$H_{\text{atm}}$: Non-reciprocal atmospheric delays (requires dual-frequency/radiometry).</li>
        <li>$H_{\text{inst}}$: Non-reciprocal instrumental delays (fiber loops, transponders).</li>
        <li><strong>$H_{\text{TEP}}$:</strong> The signal of interest (residual synchronization holonomy).</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    The experimental challenge is to model or control the first five terms to isolate the sixth.
</p>

<div class="key-concept">
    <h4>Measurement Recipe</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Record emission and reception time tags for each directed link (A→B, B→C, C→A and reverse)</li>
        <li>Compute $H_{\text{raw}}$ from tags using the estimator definition above</li>
        <li>Model $H_{\text{GR}}$ using ephemerides, Earth-orientation parameters, and propagation models</li>
        <li>Compute $H_{\text{resid}} = H_{\text{raw}} - H_{\text{GR}}$</li>
        <li>Repeat across geometries chosen to hold Sagnac projection fixed while varying field-gradient sensitivity</li>
        <li>Report residual scaling with geometry; publish nuisance-model sensitivity</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="key-concept">
    <h4>GR Prediction</h4>
    <p>
        In GR, after subtracting the modeled loop contributions H<sub>GR</sub>, the residual satisfies 
        H<sub>resid</sub> = 0 (up to measurement uncertainty).
    </p>
    
    <h4>TEP Prediction</h4>
    <p>
        In the conformal-only limit (B = 0), the A(φ) contribution to time transport is an exact gradient and yields 
        H<sub>resid</sub> = 0 once GR loop effects are subtracted. A nonzero residual holonomy requires non-exact 
        structure, for example disformal coupling B(φ) ≠ 0 or more general non-metricity. In that case, 
        H<sub>resid</sub> can be nonzero with a magnitude that depends on loop geometry and field gradients.
    </p>
</div>

<h4>8.1.2 Distinguishing TEP Holonomy from Sagnac Effect</h4>

<p>
    A skeptic will immediately note that any closed loop on a rotating Earth measures the 
    Sagnac effect ($\Delta t = 4A\Omega/c^2$). The triangle holonomy test must explicitly 
    distinguish TEP effects from Sagnac rotation.
</p>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>Geometric vs Rotational Signatures</h4>
    
    <p><strong>Sagnac Effect:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Area-dependent:</strong> $\Delta t_{Sagnac} = 4A\Omega/c^2$ where A is the enclosed area</li>
        <li><strong>Rotation-axis dependent:</strong> Proportional to Earth's rotation rate $\Omega$</li>
        <li><strong>Direction:</strong> Fixed sign determined by right-hand rule with rotation axis</li>
        <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> Order picoseconds for terrestrial-scale triangles (configuration-dependent)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Residual Holonomy (TEP target):</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Area-dependent:</strong> $H_{\text{resid}} \propto (B/A)|\nabla\phi|^2 \times \text{Area}$ (depends on loop flux)</li>
        <li><strong>Field-gradient dependent:</strong> Proportional to scalar field gradient and disformal coupling</li>
        <li><strong>Geometry:</strong> Optimized by large vertical or orbital loops sampling field gradients</li>
        <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> Order $H/T_{loop} \sim 10^{-18}$–$10^{-16}$ in the forecasts considered here (model- and geometry-dependent)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    The numerical values quoted below are order-of-magnitude forecasts intended to clarify the experimental scale. In practice, the effective Sagnac term and the achievable subtraction residual depend on loop geometry, ephemerides and Earth-orientation modeling, link non-reciprocity control, and the time-transfer calibration strategy.
</p>

<h4>8.1.3 The Large-Area Strategy</h4>

<p>
    Contrary to "zero-area" approaches that eliminate signal along with noise, the original TEP framework 
    (Smawfield 2025e) emphasizes that the holonomy $H$ scales with the loop area (flux of the time-transport curvature). 
    To maximize the signal-to-noise ratio, a Large-Area MEO Strategy is proposed:
</p>

<div class="key-insight">
    <h4>Ground-Satellite-Ground Triangle</h4>
    <p>
        Configure stations A and B on the ground separated by 1000–3000 km, with a Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) 
        satellite S completing the triangle ($A \to S \to B \to A$):
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Large Area:</strong> The loop extends to ~20,000 km altitude, enclosing a vast area to maximize TEP flux.</li>
        <li><strong>Sagnac Modeling:</strong> The large Sagnac term is modeled and subtracted using precise IERS Earth orientation parameters (EOP) and GNSS/SLR ephemerides.</li>
        <li><strong>TEP Discriminator:</strong> A non-zero residual $H_{\text{resid}}$ after Sagnac subtraction.</li>
        <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Two-way optical time transfer (TWTTFT) links combined with one-way analysis.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        This configuration maximizes sensitivity to the disformal coupling $B(\phi)$, targeting the 
        predicted $H/T_{loop} \sim 10^{-18}-10^{-16}$ fractional holonomy.
    </p>

    <h4>Numerical Predictions for MEO Configuration</h4>

    <p>
        The signal lies at the frontier of detectability. Isolating an attosecond-level residual from the ~100 ns Sagnac background requires differential measurements across multiple geometries. These targets should be regarded as indicative feasibility thresholds rather than finalized performance specifications.

<h4>8.1.4 Explicit Error Budget</h4>

    The experimental design relies on precise modeling to isolate the TEP residual. The Sagnac effect poses the most significant challenge:

    <p>
        Challenge: Absolute Sagnac subtraction is ultimately limited by geodetic and dynamical modeling (satellite orbits, Earth rotation, and link calibration). Detecting sub-femtosecond residuals therefore requires differential strategies (comparing loops with different field-gradient sensitivities but similar Sagnac projections) rather than relying solely on absolute subtraction. Feasibility depends on achieving the required link precision and systematic control.

<h4>8.1.5 Multiple Geometries for Cross-Validation</h4>

    <h4>Geometry Discrimination Strategy</h4>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Large-area triangle:</strong> Maximizes TEP signal (flux of time-transport curvature).</li>

        Consistency across geometries provides robust discrimination between residual holonomy $H_{\text{resid}}$ 
        and Sagnac rotation effects.

<h4>8.1.7 The Critical Innovation</h4>
 
<p>
    The key requirement is genuinely one-way links. Current time transfer methods 
    (two-way satellite time transfer, GPS common-view) use round-trip or common-mode 
    techniques that cancel holonomy by construction.
</p>
 
<p>
    One-way optical links between ground stations and satellites (or between satellites) 
    could provide the required configuration. The European Space Agency's ACES mission 
    includes a one-way link capability that could, in principle, be used for holonomy 
    measurements—though this is not part of the planned science program.
</p>

<h4>8.1.8 Objections and Replies</h4>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>Common Objections</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Objection: One-way times are convention-dependent; the observable is not physical.</li>
        <li>Objection: Any loop timing signal is just the Sagnac effect (Earth rotation).</li>
        <li>Objection: Atmospheric and link delays dominate the femtosecond/attosecond signal.</li>
        <li>Objection: Subtracting $H_{GR}$ assumes GR and makes the test circular.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="key-insight">
    <h4>Replies (Operational and Falsifiable)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Reply: The loop observable $H_{raw}$ is constructed from recorded emission time tags and reception clock readouts; constant clock offsets cancel exactly in the direction-reversed loop difference.</li>
        <li>Reply: Sagnac contributions are geometry-controlled. Using precise IERS Earth-orientation parameters and satellite ephemerides, the modeled Sagnac term can be subtracted to the level set by geodetic uncertainty. The key discriminator is a residual with the predicted geometry dependence, validated across multiple loop configurations.</li>
        <li>Reply: Link systematics are handled by two-way optical time transfer (TWTTFT) for synchronization and one-way analysis, plus dual-frequency links. The signal scales with loop area (flux), while many systematics scale with path length or are geometry-independent.</li>
        <li>Reply: $H_{GR}$ subtraction is treated as a modeled calibration. The discriminator is whether a <em>residual</em> remains that scales with field gradients (TEP) rather than rotation (Sagnac).</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h4>8.1.9 Formal Note: Why Conformal-Only Models Give H<sub>resid</sub> = 0</h4>

<div class="key-concept">
    <h4>Exactness and Residual Holonomy</h4>
    <p>
        In the theory formulation, time transport along a link can be represented by an effective one-form Ω. In the conformal-only limit (B = 0), Ω reduces to an exact gradient term, Ω ∝ d(ln A)/2, whose curl vanishes. After subtracting modeled GR loop effects (Sagnac, Shapiro, gravito-magnetic terms), the residual loop integral therefore satisfies H<sub>resid</sub> = ∮Ω = 0 on simply connected domains. A nonzero residual requires a non-exact contribution, for example a disformal term B(φ) ≠ 0 or more general non-metricity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout the paper, references to H<sub>resid</sub> as a discriminator should therefore be understood as targeting disformal or non-metric structure in the clock sector, not the purely conformal limit.
    </p>
</div>

<h4>8.1.10 The Conformal-Only Limit and TEP Testability</h4>

<p>
    The preceding analysis raises a critical question: if conformal-only TEP (B = 0) predicts H<sub>resid</sub> = 0 
    after GR subtraction—identical to GR—how can the triangle holonomy test discriminate between the theories?
</p>

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>Resolution: Multi-Signature Discrimination Strategy</h4>
    
    <p>
        The holonomy test primarily constrains disformal coupling B(φ), while GNSS and clock-correlation 
        observables provide sensitivity to conformal-sector structure via A(φ). TEP remains 
        testable in the conformal-only limit through complementary observables:
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The following signatures are currently best viewed as hypotheses motivated by preliminary 
        analyses rather than established empirical facts:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>GNSS Distance Correlations:</strong> Exponential-like distance structure in clock residual correlations on continental-to-global baselines (order 10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> km) has been reported in GNSS clock products. This claim requires independent replication using raw data and explicit systematic controls.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Orbital Velocity Coupling:</strong> A correlation between GNSS-derived metrics and Earth's orbital dynamics has been reported. Establishing whether this reflects physics or analysis artifacts requires independent replication with pre-specified endpoints and null tests.</li>
        
        <li><strong>CMB Frame Alignment:</strong> Approximate alignment of an inferred anisotropy direction with the CMB dipole has been reported. This claim, if robustly replicated, would discriminate preferred-frame structure in the clock sector from standard GR expectations.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Multi-Constellation Consistency:</strong> If the signal is physical (conformal coupling 
        to matter), it must appear identically across GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou. Systematic artifacts 
        would show constellation-dependent variations.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
        The triangle holonomy test serves a different purpose: it constrains or detects 
        <em>disformal</em> coupling B(φ). GW170817 bounds the fractional GW–EM speed difference |c<sub>g</sub> − c<sub>γ</sub>|/c at the few × 10<sup>−15</sup> level under standard emission-time assumptions, strongly constraining disformal cone tilts in many scalar-tensor models (e.g., Ezquiaga &amp; 
        Zumalacárregui 2017). Clock-sector disformal 
        coupling could differ and remain detectable at the attosecond-level residuals targeted in Table 8.1.3. 
        These residual levels should be regarded as indicative feasibility thresholds rather than finalized performance specifications.

    <p>
        Bottom line: TEP is falsifiable even if B = 0. The conformal sector makes distinct 
        predictions (distance correlations, velocity coupling, frame alignment) that GR does not. The holonomy 
        test adds sensitivity to disformal structure if present, but is not the sole discriminator.
    </p>
</div>

<h3>8.2 Interplanetary Closed-Loop Timing</h3>

<p>
    Deep space baselines are attractive for probing disformal structure because they accumulate propagation effects over long paths. However, a two-point one-way asymmetry is not, by itself, an operational observable because it depends on unknown clock offsets and drifts between endpoints. An interplanetary discriminator therefore requires an explicitly offset-invariant, direction-reversing closed-loop construction.
</p>

<h4>8.2.1 The Observable: AU-Scale Loop Holonomy</h4>

<div class="key-concept">
    <h4>Estimator</h4>
    <p>
        Consider three nodes, such as an Earth station A and two spacecraft B and C. Each link is a one-way, time-tagged optical transfer giving $\Delta_{ij} = \tau_j^r - \tau_i^e$.
    </p>
    <p>
        The raw AU-scale loop holonomy is defined by the direction-reversed loop difference:

    <div class="equation">
        $$H_{\text{AU,raw}} \equiv (\Delta_{AB} + \Delta_{BC} + \Delta_{CA}) - (\Delta_{AC} + \Delta_{CB} + \Delta_{BA}).$$

<div class="critical-analysis">
    <h4>Operational Invariance</h4>

        Constant clock offsets cancel algebraically in $H_{\text{AU,raw}}$ by the same mechanism as in the terrestrial triangle test. The observable is therefore well-defined without assuming an external synchronization convention, provided that emission and reception time tags are recorded for each one-way link.
    </p>
</div>

<h4>8.2.2 Physical Content</h4>

<p>
    The signal of interest is the GR-subtracted residual holonomy $H_{\text{AU,resid}} = H_{\text{AU,raw}} - H_{\text{AU,GR}}$. The modeled GR term includes Shapiro delay contributions from solar-system bodies, kinematic loop terms from platform motion, and plasma dispersion. A nonzero residual with the predicted geometry dependence would indicate non-exact time transport beyond the modeled GR loop effects.
</p>

<h4>8.2.3 Proposed Configuration</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Three-node geometry using one Earth terminal and two spacecraft (or one spacecraft plus a second Earth terminal), enabling both loop orientations.</li>
    <li>Optical time transfer with recorded emission and reception time tags for each directed link.</li>
    <li>Dual-frequency calibration (or independent plasma monitoring) to control dispersive delays.</li>
    <li>End-to-end modeling of ephemerides and Shapiro delays to construct $H_{\text{AU,GR}}$.</li>
</ul>

    <p>
        This test is technologically demanding because it couples precision time transfer to deep-space navigation and plasma calibration. Its primary value is conceptual: it upgrades interplanetary timing from a convention-dependent two-node asymmetry to an offset-invariant, closed-loop observable.

<h3>8.3 GNSS Correlation Replication</h3>

<p>
    Exploratory analyses within the TEP research program have suggested distance-structured correlations in GNSS 
    clock data with correlation length on the order of 10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> km. Independent, blinded replication of 
    this analysis would provide strong evidence for or against the TEP interpretation.
</p>

<h4>8.3.1 The Existing Evidence</h4>

<p>
    Exploratory analysis from the TEP research program, using 25 years of CODE clock products 
    and cross-validated with IGS and ESA analysis centers, suggests:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Exponential decay of clock correlations with distance</li>
    <li>Correlation length of order a few × 10<sup>3</sup> km (reported example: λ ≈ few × 10<sup>3</sup> km under one estimator)</li>
    <li>Consistency across three independent analysis centers (R² = 0.92–0.97)</li>
    <li>Orbital-dynamics coupling (reported correlation with Earth's orbital velocity)</li>
    <li>Approximate alignment with the CMB frame (reported within tens of degrees)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Status:</strong> These findings constitute preliminary evidence requiring independent 
    replication. This paper treats them as a motivating hypothesis and does not assume their numerical values when specifying the discriminating measurement geometries.
</p>

<h4>8.3.2 The Reproducibility Mandate</h4>

<p>
    For these claims to be scientifically accepted, future analysis must move beyond preliminary 
    reports to a fully transparent <strong>Reproducibility Package</strong>. Any confirming study must provide:
</p>

<div class="key-concept">
    <h4>Required Reproducibility Standards</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Exact Datasets:</strong> Specification of precise products (e.g., IGS `clk` 30s vs 5m), specific stations (IGS site IDs), and exact time windows used.</li>
        <li><strong>Preprocessing Pipeline:</strong> Full code or algorithmic description of outlier removal, reference clock definition, and detrending methods (linear vs polynomial).</li>
        <li><strong>Null Simulations:</strong> Injection/recovery tests where synthetic TEP signals are added to noise to verify detection efficiency, and "scrambled" null tests (randomizing station locations) to verify zero signal.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple-Testing Corrections:</strong> Statistical penalties for searching across multiple correlation lengths ($\lambda$) and lag times.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Without these controls, exponential fits to noisy residuals can be spurious. The TEP program commits to releasing a public codebase (TEP-GNSS-Open) meeting these standards.
    </p>
</div>

<h4>8.3.3 Replication Requirements</h4>

<p>
    Independent replication should:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Use raw GNSS data (not processed clock products) to avoid filtering artifacts</li>
    <li>Apply minimal processing to preserve spatial correlations</li>
    <li>Test multiple constellations (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou)</li>
    <li>Verify the correlation length is consistent across datasets</li>
    <li>Test for systematic artifacts (ionospheric, tropospheric, orbital)</li>
</ol>

<h4>8.3.4 Falsification Criteria</h4>

<p>
    The TEP interpretation would be falsified if:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Correlation length falls outside 500-20,000 km range</li>
    <li>Correlations disappear in raw (unprocessed) data</li>
    <li>Correlations are explained by known systematic effects</li>
    <li>Different constellations show inconsistent correlation lengths</li>
</ul>

<h3>8.4 Optical Clock Networks and Environmental Screening</h3>

<p>
    The next generation of optical clock networks—connected by optical fiber or 
    free-space links—could provide unprecedented sensitivity to synchronization structure 
    and environmental screening mechanisms.
</p>

<h4>8.4.1 Current Developments</h4>

<p>
    Several projects are developing continental-scale optical clock networks:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>European fiber network connecting national metrology institutes</li>
    <li>NIST-JILA optical link in Boulder, Colorado</li>
    <li>Proposed intercontinental optical links</li>
</ul>

<h4>8.4.2 TEP Sensitivity: Two Phases</h4>

<p>
    <strong>Phase I: Distance Correlations.</strong> Optical clocks achieve $10^{-18}$ stability, 
    potentially sensitive to distance-dependent correlations at the 
    $\delta\tau/\tau \sim 10^{-18}$ level over 1000 km baselines.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Phase II: Environmental Screening Maps.</strong> TEP predicts that the scalar field profile $\phi(x)$ 
    is screened by local matter density. Comparing clocks at different altitudes (sea level vs mountain vs LEO) 
    allows mapping the screening profile. After subtracting GR redshift, TEP predicts residual frequency shifts 
    of $10^{-19}$–$10^{-18}$ over tens of kilometers for a screening length $\lambda_{scr} \sim 10$ km.
</p>

<h4>8.4.3 Critical Design Considerations</h4>

<p>
    To test TEP, optical clock networks must:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use one-way comparisons (not just common-mode rejection)</li>
    <li>Span continental-to-global baselines (order 10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> km)</li>
    <li>Operate continuously to detect temporal variations</li>
    <li>Deploy transportable clocks to varying environments (density/altitude) to test screening</li>
</ul>

<h3>8.5 Matter-Wave Interferometry</h3>

<p>
    Atom interferometers provide a complementary probe sensitive to the gradients of the conformal factor $\nabla \ln A(\phi)$.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Measure $\nabla\nabla \ln A(\phi)$ via differential phases in atom interferometers.</li>
    <li><strong>Design:</strong> Long-baseline or tall fountain interferometers (Sr, Rb) in gradiometric configurations.</li>
    <li><strong>Discrimination:</strong> Combine with mechanical gravimeters. GR affects both; TEP scalar gradients affect atoms (via $A(\phi)$) differently from bulk mass (if composition-dependent couplings exist, though A is universal at leading order).</li>
</ul>

<h3>8.6 Explicit TEP Predictions</h3>

<p>
    To ensure falsifiability, TEP makes specific numerical predictions for each proposed test. 
    These predictions are derived from the theoretical framework (Smawfield 2025a). Numerical ranges are order-of-magnitude targets; where they are informed by reported GNSS analyses, they are treated as provisional pending independent replication.

<div class="key-insight">
    <h4>Phenomenological Benchmark</h4>
    <p>
        Some phenomenological discussions adopt a working benchmark correlation length on the order of 10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> km (as reported in GNSS analyses) to illustrate experimental sensitivity and to parameterize a representative screening scale. This manuscript does not rely on that benchmark: the underdetermination and the proposed discriminating observables are defined independently of any particular GNSS-derived parameter value.
    </p>
    <p>
        Independent replication remains essential. If replication fails to confirm a robust distance-structured correlation in raw GNSS observables, any GNSS-informed parameter inference (including mapping an effective correlation length to a field mass scale) would require revision.

<p>
    These experiments share a common feature: they break the two-way symmetry that 
    characterizes existing precision tests. By measuring one-way propagation, closed-loop 
    residual holonomy H<sub>resid</sub>, or spatial correlations, they probe the synchronization structure that 
    distinguishes GR from TEP.
</p>

<p>
    None of these experiments has been performed with the explicit goal of testing 
    synchronization integrability. The experimental frontier lies not in achieving 
    greater precision within existing paradigms but in designing fundamentally new 
    measurement configurations.
</p>
